This is my first attempt at rendering particles using react three fiber.

## Installation
I may have a demo running at [maxmoir.dev](url), but if you want to test it yourself, you can download the repo here:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxwmoir/particles.git
```
## Usage
After entering the project directory, install the required packages with npm install.
Then you can test the project by running:
```bash
npm run dev
```
